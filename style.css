****************************************
* ERMAGERD, WHERE ARE MA STYLES??!?!?? *
****************************************
With Air, we are making a big leap by moving from Sass/SCSS in Plate to TailwindCSS
which is based on PostCSS. Check out TailwindCSS here: https://tailwindcss.com/

As a result of this big change, it made sense to create an all-new theme. Air was 
forked from our Plate theme and then rebuilt from the ground up. Read on.

The main stylesheet is found here: /library/css/theme-styles.css which includes all of
the Tailwind base + utility styles as well as our custom imports. 

Use `npm run dev` to process the styles or `npm run watch` to process on every change which
will compile the styles to: /library/css/styles.css which is the stylesheet called in the theme.

For production, run `npm run prod` to create a minified production build. We've included PurgeCSS
which intelligently removes any Tailwind styles you are not using for production. Sweetness.

See detailed instructions in the README.md. 

Why TailwindCSS?
TailwindCSS is a whole new way to think about styling with CSS and it will make your 
life as a developer easier. Just trust me on this. I was skeptical at first too
and I *love* using Sass/SCSS so hear me out.

TailwindCSS is a *utility-first* framework and what that means is it comes with 
pre-set utility classes that you can add to your html *right now*. In short,
the CSS classes you add to your HTML do all the styling work so you will have to write
very little CSS. This is huge. But your CSS will be small.

Instead of coming up with non-intuitive class names and adding your own styles to each element, 
with TailwindCSS you just add the classes you need to your markup. The classes are declarative
and are reusable everywhere. Learn them once, use them everywhere.

See this example from the docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first/

Breaking out styles by media queries is no longer necessary as you can add breakpoint-specific 
classes. This is true modular CSS that makes sense and is actually fun to use.

Yet, you can still use a lot of the good things from Sass/SCSS like nested selectors, variables,
and more. If you're dead-set on still using Sass/SCSS and a preprocessor you *can* still
do that with a bit more configuration but with Tailwind you really won't need to.

Sure, there's a little bit of a learning curve but that's only to learn the CSS
classes that Tailwind provides. Once you've got a handle on those, your development
will be faster, better, stronger, and you will become immortal. Or at least a better
developer with more tools in your toolbox. You really just have to try it.

Workflow
PostCSS and Tailwind uses modern JavaScript tooling to process your stylesheets. What's cool
about that is you can extend Tailwind with your own configuration and plugins creating a 
completely customized setup for your particular theme.

We've provided the proper boilerplate with Air for you to avoid most of the configuration
pain points get up-and-running fast. Under the hood we're using Laravel Mix which is a really
nice Webpack wrapper that allows running node modules anywhere.

/*
WordPress Stuffs
We use Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) to test every
Plate release. Theme Check whines about not having these classes present even
though they are in the REAL stylesheet in library/css/style.css. So that's why
they are here. You don't need to touch these.
